--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

SELECT * FROM  BIT_DB.customers LIMIT 20;
-- What columns are in customers? order_id and acctnum

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;
--What columns are in January Sales? orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, and location
--Customers and JanSales have orderiD in common. 

-- Messy Data
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers; 
--... means the rows contain more data than what's being displayed in other rows
--Order ID

--How to fix messy data
--filter it out
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers WHERE length(order_id)=6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID';
SELECT COUNT(order_id) FROM BIT_DB.customers WHERE length(order_id)=6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID';
--IS NOT NULL 
-- orderid = <> '' 

--1. How many orders were placed in January? 9681
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID' 
    AND Product = 'iPhone'; 

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT BIT_DB.customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID = BIT_DB.customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? AAA, 2.99
SELECT Product, Min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, price, SUM(quantity)*price AS 'Revenue'
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product; 

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(quantity)*price, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY Product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


--Data Filtering Techniques

SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00'; 

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate LIKE '02/18/19%'; 

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Batteries%';

Select distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Price LIKE '%.99'; 

SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
